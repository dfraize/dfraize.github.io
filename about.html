      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-500 mb-4">My Background</h2>
      <p class="text-slate-800 mb-4">During the summer of 1999, I participated in a certificate program at Boston University where I really became proficient at HTML. I began my new position in May of 2000 after my college graduation. The development side came pretty natural. I have a knack for picking up new things (like programming languages) quickly. Once I completed my first and website build I knew I was in trouble â€“ I liked both design and development equally. In a business world that wants efficient moving pieces that contribute unique portions to the company as a whole, I was going against the grain by embracing two skill sets.</p>
      <p class="text-slate-800 mb-4">The experience and skill that I developed in college helped me to acquire my first position in the field. After working for a couple of start ups I landed a role as design/developer at Experience.com. I spent five years doing design and development work which I found to be a big interest playing this dual role.</p>
      <p class="text-slate-800 mb-4">After Experience, I started a new role at SimpleTuition as the Lead UX/UI Design another startup focused on student load comparison. It was at SimpleTuition that I was introduced And lead the concepts of design systems and custom UI frameworks. I lead the the design and development of SimpleTuitions UI framework until I left the company in 2012.</p>
      <p class="text-slate-800 mb-4">I then brought my knowledge of design systems and custom UI frameworks to Mercer, the worlds largest HR consulting company. I was hired to lead and contributed to the design and building of the companies first UI framework and multiple design systems.</p>
      <p class="text-slate-800">I have the ability to span across different areas of expertise. Over my professional career I've been able to use my experience in both design and development to help identify and prioritize the goals of projects to improve the overall experience for their end-users while also being able to design those experiences and implement them in code.</p>
